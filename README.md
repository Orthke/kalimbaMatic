# The Project
After seeing a kalimba video on an instagram reel, I thought to myself "that looks pretty easy". So one Amazon order and $10 later I had my very own. The basics were easy to pickup, but I saw lots of potential for complex songs that you couldn't play with just two thumbs.

There has to be a way to automate this...

Another Amazon order for 20 tower pro 9g servers, an adafruit 16 channel I2C PWM servo controller...

More to come...
